# BeatAudio
## Audio beat editing software.

BeatAudio is a software that allows you to change the configuration of beats in a song.

## Features

- Remove every Nth beat (in a group of K beats)
- Swap Nth beat with Kth beat (in a group of C beats)
- Double beats in a group of N beats

You can create videos like "[song name] but every other beat is swapped", "[song name] but beats 3 and 4 are gone" etc using this software. It allows you to experience a song you've already heard, in a new light.

It also supports several transformations being applied, so there are no limits on your creativity!

## Documentation

Every action contains a short usage guide/tutorial. This should allow you to understand the logic behind transformations applied. Additionally, a YT video tutorial will soon come out...
